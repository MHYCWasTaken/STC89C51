A$EDIT:      editor module used by TEdit and GEdit.
             Must be called by GEdit or TEdit
Source:      a$edit.asm (getkey.asm, isdigit.asm, toupper.asm, tolower.asm)

             TEdit and GEdit edit a string on a single row of the screen
             (without word wrap).  Strings longer than the column width of
             the screen are scrolled left or right as required.  A public
             byte in A$EDIT's data area, EWIDTH, establishes the effective
             screen width limit.  EWIDTH is a not-to-exceed limit; if the
             actual screen width is less than EWIDTH, EWIDTH is ignored
             and the actual screen width is used instead.  ASMLIB's default
             EWIDTH is 132.

             A$EDIT commands for both TEdit and GEdit are:

             Ctrl+left arrow = word left
             Ctrl+right arrow = word right
             Ctrl+end = clear to end of string
             Home = go to start of string
             End = go to end of string


             Option bits, passed to GEdit or TEdit in register AL, are:

             Option 1 = upper case input
             Option 2 = lower case input
             Option 1 OR 2 = digits only input

GEDIT:       string editor for graphics modes
             See also TEdit for text modes, A$EDIT for general information
Source:      gedit.asm (a$edit.asm, gprint.asm, a$graph.asm, gcursor.asm,
                        strspace.asm, heap.asm)

Call with:   DS:[SI] pointing to string buffer; may include a default string
             DS:[DX] pointing to x- & y-coordinates
             assumes DS:@data
             CX = byte size of buffer
             AL = option bits (see A$EDIT)
             You must initialize the near heap before calling GEdit.
             GEdit only works with DrawMode 1 or -1 (see DrawMode in
             GRAPHICS.DOC).  GEdit forces drawmode to 1 or -1 and restores
             the previous drawmode on exit.
Returns:     AX = last key pressed (see getkey for key codes)
             CX = new string length
Uses:        AX, CX, flags
Supports:    all ASMLIB graphics modes
Example:

.data
x       dw 8                      ; x-coordinate (pixels from left edge)
y       dw 100                    ; y-coordinate (pixels from top of screen)
extrn   ewidth:byte               ; byte in A$EDIT used to limit columns
                                  ; displayed

        mov   ewidth,40           ; there's stuff on the right side of
                                  ; the screen that should be left alone

        lea   si,string_buffer    ; near address of string buffer
        mov   cx,len_buffer       ; byte length of buffer for the string
        mov   al,0                ; nothing tricky
        lea   dx,x                ; point to x & y coordinates

GPICKF:      pick a file from a list of filenames
             GPickF pops a window on the screen and displays filenames
             matching an input filespec mask.  One filename may be selected
             with cursor keys or with hotkeys.  When Esc, Enter or ^C is
             pressed, GPickF restores the screen and returns the selected
             filename to the calling program.
             Unused memory must be released by STARTUP (see STARTUP.ASM or
             TINY.ASM).  Also requires near heap (see HINIT).
             See also MenuOption.
Source:      gpickf.asm (filelist.asm, $gpick.asm, a$menu.asm, $graph.asm)

(1) the first upper-case letter in each string is that string's hotkey
    no upper-case character = no hotkey
(2) the quitkey value is a keycode returned by GetKey
(3) use AX = -1 for exit when hotkey pressed, AX = 0 to disable

PULLDOWN:    pull-down menu system
Source:      pulldown.asm (a$menu.asm, tprint.asm, tprintce.asm, tputchr.asm
                           strlen.asm, wclear.asm, wframe.asm, wsize.asm
                           wsave.asm, getkey.asm, pickstr.asm and others)

Call with:   DS:[SI] pointing to menu labels
             BH = initial main menu choice, BL = initial submenu choice
             assumes DS:@data
             Unused memory must be released (see STARTUP.ASM and ENDPROG)

             If PullDown is called with BL < 0, only the main headings are
             printed initally; the submenus are printed when ENTER is
             pressed, a mouse button is pressed, or when either the down
             arrow key is pressed or a "down" mouse movement is detected.

             If PullDown is called with BL >= 0, it starts in the full main
             headings plus submenus mode.  In this mode, a mouse button
             click or the ENTER key will exit PullDown.  In either mode,
             ESC, ^C or the user-defined quitkey (see MenuOption) causes
             PullDown to return to the calling program.

             If there are too many main headings to fit across the top of the
             screen, the headings are scrolled left or right as required to
             show the selected heading.  Use Left, Right, Home and End keys
             to change selected headings.  Maximum number of headings: 20

             If there are too many submenu choices under a heading to fit
             on the screen, the selections are scrolled up or down as required
             to show the selected item.  Use Up, Down, PgUp, PgDown keys
             to change selection, or press highlighted letter of selection.
             Maximum number of selections per heading: 255

Returns:     BH = main menu choice, BL = submenu choice
             if CF = 1, ^C or Ctrl-Break was pressed
             if CF = 0
                 AX = 13 if ENTER was pressed
                 AX = user-defined quitkey if pressed (see MenuOption)
                 AX = 0 if insufficient DOS memory is available
                 AX = 27 if ESC was pressed
                 AH = 1-7, AL = 0 if mouse button pressed
Uses:        AX, BX
Supports:    text mode; all row/column configurations supported by ASMLIB
             Text subroutines
Example:

see next page

;    this sample menu has 4 main menu headings:
;                          Critters, Things, Food, Trees
;    submenu choices for each main heading follow each main heading
;    Note that each string is terminated with NUL, and that there's an
;    extra NUL between the end of the submenu choices and the next main
;    heading.
;    The entire set of menu choices is terminated with 2 NUL bytes
;
;    PULLDOWN will return to the calling program when either ESCAPE or
;    ENTER is pressed (AX = ASCII code of key pressed).  PULLDOWN returns
;    AX = 0 if insufficient memory is available to save the underlying
;    screen, or AX = 3 if breaktrap was enabled and Ctrl+Break was pressed.
;
;    On return, BH = the main heading and BL = the submenu choice in effect
;    when the key was pressed.  The first main heading is number 0, and
;    the first submenu choice for each main heading is also number 0.
