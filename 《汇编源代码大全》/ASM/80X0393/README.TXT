All the code I put into 80XXX Snippets for distribution is Public Domain 
or free to the best that I can determine.  Since 80XXX Snippets includes 
both public domain and free code, be sure to carefully read each  header
or  *.doc file for any free license restrictions which may apply. 

Some changes have been made(I hope to the better) since the last release
of the Snippets:
- All FAQ's have the extension *.FAQ
- Textfiles have the extension *.TXT
- Documentation to source files have the extension *.DOC

Filedate and filetime reflect the release:
Jul 92 snippets:  07-30-92  07:00
Sep 92 snippets:  09-30-92  09:00
Mar 93 snippets:  03-30-93  03:00
I know, nothing spectacular just gives (me) a better overview. :)

This time  there will  be no  Diff file  (80X0393D.ZIP).  I did so  many 
changes  and  reorganization that it  is highly  recomended  to  get the
complete 'collection'.

BTW,  you are more than welcome to contact me for any comments, ideas or 
suggestions to improve 80XXX Snippets.

80XXX Snippets have been released for the first time in July 1992.
Distribution (usually) will be in two files:
80Xmmyy.ZIP    full collection of 80XXX Snippets
80XmmyyD.ZIP   differential pack.  Contains only the files changed since 
               the last release
(needless to  mention  that mm  indicates the  month and yy  the year of 
release)

80XXX Snippets are distributed through  the FidoNet  Programer's Distri-
bution Network (PDNASM) and I also put them into CIS.
