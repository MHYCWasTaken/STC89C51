Re: Resident dialer
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello everyone.

Here is a little,  but great program I once wrote.  This is a resident 
background dialer for the modem.  What you do is hit SysReq,  dial the 
number you wish to call using either the  numeric  pad or the ordinary 
digits, press Enter, and the modem dials the number.  Now you have two 
possibilities:

1. If you are calling someone voice,  you pick up the  phone and press 
   any key except for  ESC.  The  modem hangs up and the  phone is  in 
   charge.

2. If you are trying to access a modem, you press ESC, and the program
   returns control to the system,  without hanging the modem up.  This 
   way you can go to your telecomm. program and run it, such as 'TELIX 
   O', ('O' to NOT init.).

The program is in very basic assembly,  and it was written quite  some 
time ago, so don't expect to much of the source.

= IMPORTANT =

Don't forget to setup the program.  It is currently  set to work  with 
COM2. If your modem is on another COM  port,  simple change  the  Port 
definition to the appropriate - COM1 = 0, COM2 = 1 etc.

Anopther thing is the dialing prefix. If your modem or phone line does 
not support TONE dial, change the 'T' in DialPre1 to 'D'.

Enjoy. Any comments will be gladly accepted.
