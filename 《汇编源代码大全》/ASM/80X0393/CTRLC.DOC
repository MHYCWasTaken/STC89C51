Re: Ctrl-C & Ctrl-Break trap
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I've been noticing a lot of discussion regarding Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Break
trapping, and the difficulties associated with it.  Here's some code I
wrote to do this; it works quite well. TASM syntax, of course:

Notes:
1. To  trap  other keys,  add the  trapping  logic  between  @@L2  and 
   @@oldHandler.
2. This code uses int 16h, function 12h (Get enhanced keyboard flags). 
   If you  don't have an  enhanced keyboard,  I  don't know what  will
   happen. I guess int 16h, function 02h would be in order. Of course,
   you could just take a peek at 40:17,  but I've let the BIOS do  the 
   job for compatability.
3. I've got a P386 at the top. There aren't any 386+ instructions, but
   I threw it in for alignment.  In fact, I don't think there's even a
   286 instruction  in  there.  Who knows?  If there is,  it's nothing 
   that's hard to change.
4. I've  tried all sorts of  ways to confuse this  code, but  it  kept  
   working.  If anyone finds  something  wrong with it,  please let me 
   know.

Please direct any questions or comments to either 80XXX or 1:247/128.2
whichever is appropriate.

Hope it helps,

        Matt
