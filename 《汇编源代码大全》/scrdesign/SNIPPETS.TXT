INFORMATION ABOUT SNIPPETS 4/93 EDITION
=======================================

Beginning with the 12/92 edition, SNIPPETS is being distributed in two forms.

The first, and most familiar, is the full SNIPPETS collection. As before it
is named "SNIPdddd.xxx", where "dddd" is the release date and "xxx" is the
archive utility extension. For example, I distribute the 12/92 edition as
SNIP1292.LZH, using the LHA.EXE archive utility.

New to the 12/92 release was SNIPDIFF, an archive containing both files and a
utility to create a complete and fully-validated SNIPPETS archive using files
from the last edition of SNIPPETS which haven't changed. This represents a
considerable saving in the size of the archive and, consequently, the time
required to download it from bulletin boards and public information services.

Beginning the 4/93 release, SNIPDIFF becomes even smaller with the inclusion
of DSAPP.EXE which allows that only the differences for changed files need be
included. DSAPP.EXE is a public domain utility for applying changes, written
by David Burton, and which is distributed with his excellent TLIB revision
control system.
